## 🔧 KEY TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATIONS

### 1. Registration Logic Enhancement
```python
# Students: Automatically approved and active
if form.user_type.data == 'student':
    approval_status = 'Approved'
    user_status = 'Active'
# Instructors/Companies: Pending approval, inactive
else:
    approval_status = 'Pending'
    user_status = 'Inactive'
```

### 2. Login Security Implementation
```python
# Check approval status first
if user.get('ApprovalStatus') == 'Pending':
    flash('Your account is pending approval. Please wait for admin approval.', 'warning')
    return render_template('login.html', form=form)

# Check if user status is active
if user.get('Status') != 'Active':
    flash('Your account is not active. Please contact administrator.', 'danger')
    return render_template('login.html', form=form)
```

### 3. Database Schema Fixes Applied
```sql
-- Added missing LastLogin column
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN LastLogin DATETIME NULL;

-- Created user activity log table
CREATE TABLE user_activity_log (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    user_id INT,
    activity_type VARCHAR(100),
    timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(UserID)
);

-- Ensured ApprovalStatus column exists
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN ApprovalStatus ENUM('Pending', 'Approved', 'Rejected') DEFAULT 'Pending';
```
